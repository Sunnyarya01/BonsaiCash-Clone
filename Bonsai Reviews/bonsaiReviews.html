                invoicing service. The ability to send and sign contracts was a
                game changer for me. No one else offers such a seamless process
                from proposal to contract to invoice. It has saved me a lot of
                time and lets me focus on creative work."

                "I've been a Bonsai user for years. It has allowed me to grow my
                career as a fulltime freelancer especially with the ease of
                making contracts and collecting payments. With a variety of
                clients that are all on different payment schedules, Bonsai
                provided options for each client without difficulty. Now I am
                enjoying Bonsai even more that they have added the additional
                accounting and tax assistance. This quarter I was able to save
                so much more time filing quarterly tax payments thanks to the
                tax assistance feature. Thanks, Bonsai for understanding what
                freelancers need at every stage of their freelance career."

                work from an amateur side-gig to a full-time business. It pays
                for itself 2x over in the time I save having everything so
                seamlessly integrated. I love how I'm able to send
                professional-looking invoices, track billable and non-billable
                hours, create to-do lists, track finances/expenses, and even
                create contracts and proposals all in one place. The integration
                with Google Calendar is a huge plus, the customer service is
                beyond stellar, the platform is really intuitive and easy to
                use... Really can't say enough good things about it."

                what I love about it; proposals, contracts, invoices - all
                managed under the same umbrella. This alone has provided a great
                and streamlined experience for my clients. Bonsai is my armor to
                get what I’m worth. How I benefit most from Bonsai is having a
